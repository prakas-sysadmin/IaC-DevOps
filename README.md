# What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

IaC stands for Infrastructure as Code. It is a practice in DevOps where infrastructure is managed and provisioned through code, rather than manual configuration. This allows for more consistent and repeatable infrastructure management, version control, and easier collaboration among teams. Common IaC tools include Terraform, CloudFormation, and Ansible.
